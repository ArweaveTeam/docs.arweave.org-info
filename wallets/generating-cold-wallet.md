# Generating a Cold Wallet

The following procedure allows you to generate an extremely secure Arweave cold wallet. Using this procedure, your keys will never be exposed to an internet-connected computer before you intend to use your tokens, giving you exceptionally strong guarantees about the security of your AR.

### Cold Wallet generation with the ArDrive CLI (Advanced)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**This process is for more advanced users. If you have not used a CLI before, it is recommended to follow the guides above!**
{% endhint %}

1. You'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/) installed for the ArDrive CLI to work.
2. Open up your OS' default terminal and install the [ArDrive CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ardrive-cli) with the following command:
```sh
npm install -g ardrive-cli
```
3. Disconnect your device from the internet.
4. Generate a seedphrase with the following command, then write it down on a piece of paper.
```sh
ardrive generate-seedphrase
```
5. Copy the generated seedphrase and paste it between the quotes in the following command. Run the command to generate a keyfile.
```sh
ardrive generate-wallet -s "PASTE_GENERATED_SEEDPHRASE_HERE" > ./wallet.json
```
6. You'll be able to find you keyfile name `wallet.json` in the directory where you ran the CLI. You should copy it to an offline storage medium and delete the file from your device.
7. You can now reconnect your device to the internet.
