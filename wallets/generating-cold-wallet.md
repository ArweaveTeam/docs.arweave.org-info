2. Right click on the new Arweave icon in your browser, then select ‘Options’ 
3. Disconnect your computer from the internet 
4. Click ‘Wallets’ in the top right-hand corner of the page
5. Click ‘Create New Wallet’
6. Save this file somewhere safe on your machine

8. Click ‘Load Wallet’ on the web extension and load the key file
9. Set a password
10. Mouse over the wallet address and copy it into a temporary location for use in step 14
