# ArConnect

ArConnect is a powerful webextension-based crypto wallet, developed for Arweave. It allows you to manage your AR tokens, PSTs and NFTs easily.

## Installation

As a webextension, ArConnect needs to be installed in your browser in order to work. This process is quite simple, you can install it the same way you would install any other extensions or add-ons. It can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arconnect/einnioafmpimabjcddiinlhmijaionap) for Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, etc.) and from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arconnect/) for Firefox.

## Setup

1. Once installed, ArConnect will take you through it's onboarding process. If the setup page did not open, you can click on the ArConnect icon, in the browser's extension section (seen below).

  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="../.gitbook/assets/arconnect_chrome_extensions_list.png" alt="ArConnect Chrome Icon" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="../.gitbook/assets/arconnect_firefox_extensions_list.png" alt="ArConnect Chrome Icon" />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center;">Chrome</td>
    <td style="text-align: center;">Firefox</td>
  </tr>
</table>

2. Once you're in the setup, you're going to see something simular to the picture below. Here you'll need to create a password. Fill out the password inputs and click "Create".

3. On the next screen, click the "New Wallet" button to generate an empty wallet. If you already have an Arweave wallet seedphrase or keyfile, you can also click "Load Wallet" and follow the instructions there.

4. After clicking on the "New Wallet" button, you'll see a screen with 12 words. This is going to be your seedphrase. You should write it down on a piece of paper and store it in a secure place. **Do not close the tab yet, as your wallet is still generating!**

5. Once the wallet has generated, a button with the text "Download Keyfile" will appear. Click it to download the generated keyfile.

*You can also do this later in the ArConnect settings, by clicking on the download icon, next to your wallet address in the "Download Config" page. (Settings -> Download Config).*

6. You can now close the setup page. Don't worry, you'll still be able to create new wallets in the extension.

## About wallets stored in ArConnect

You can add and remove wallets to ArConnect at any point in time, in the extension. This means, that any wallet you add to ArConnect will be saved in your browser's storage. 
No need to worry though: all browsers provide a secure and isolated storage interface for extensions, so your wallet never leaves your device.

## Managing wallets

1. You can view/add/remove/rename wallets inside the extension. Click on the extension icon to open up ArConnect.
