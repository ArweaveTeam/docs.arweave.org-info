# Mining Reward Factors

## **How can I** optimize **my mining performance?**

To learn how to best optimize your miners SPoRA rate, [click here](https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide#estimating-and-measuring-the-hashrate).

Hard drive space will become an increasingly important part of the mining process as more data is stored in the system. However, the most efficient miners in the Arweave network will combine all three categories: hard drive space, bandwidth, and computational power.

We also recommend that you join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DzNZPaZ) community, as members of our mining channel will be able to offer help on how to best-optimize your efforts

## **How much RAM do I need to dedicate?**

We currently recommend a minimum of 8 GB of RAM

## **Is CPU or GPU mining more effective?**

The hashing algorithm used underneath the proof of access mechanism in the Arweave is [RandomX](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX), for which the CPU is the most efficient miner currently available
