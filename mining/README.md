# Arweave Mining Documentation

This section provides comprehensive documentation for running, tuning, and operating Arweave mining infrastructure.

The mining documentation is organized into the following major sections:

- **Getting Started**: Choose your node type, plan hardware, install and configure your system, and bring your first miner online.
- **Operations & Monitoring**: Day‑to‑day running of a miner, dashboards, metrics, and operational playbooks.
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues, diagnostics, and recovery procedures.
- **Tuning & Optimization**: Improving performance, efficiency, and reliability for production‑grade miners.
- **Advanced Topics**: Deeper architectural and protocol topics relevant to mining at scale.

Existing mining guides from previous versions have been preserved under the **Legacy Guides & References** section so they can be merged into the new structure.
