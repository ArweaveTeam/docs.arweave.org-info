# Mining – Getting Started

This guide walks you through planning, installing, and bringing an Arweave miner online for the first time.

{% hint style="info" %}
For any questions and support queries regarding mining on Arweave, we strongly recommend that you join our [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/GHB4fxVv8B) and visit our [Github Discussions](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/discussions) as these are the hubs of our mining and developer communities. There you will find plenty of community members and Arweave team members available to help you out 🤖
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Miners are responsible for their own compliance with data protection laws (such as GDPR) and other applicable laws in their jurisdiction. Data storage laws vary country to country. Failure to adhere to these laws may entail substantial legal risks for the miner. Please only participate in mining Arweave data if you have understood the legal implications of doing so and consider seeking legal advice.&#x20;

## 1. Choose Your Node Type

Decide whether you are running a solo miner, coordinated miner, pool miner, VDF server, or validator.  
See: [Node Types](overview/node-types.md)

## 2. Plan Your Hardware

Size CPU, memory, storage, and network based on your chosen role.  
See: [Hardware Guid](setup/hardware.md)

## 3. Configure the Operating System

Configure your operating system for Arweave workloads.  
See: [Operating System Configuration](setup/os.md)

## 4. Install the Arweave Node

Install the node software either from pre-built binaries or by building from source, and verify the installation.  
See: [Installing Arweave](setup/install.md)

## Step 5 – Configure the Node and Wallet

Create or import a wallet, configure node settings (data directories, logging, flags), and set up the node as a service.  
See: [Node and Wallet Configuration](setup/node-and-wallet.md)

## Step 6 – Understand Startup Phases

On first start, the node builds entropy, syncs and packs data, and finally begins active mining; knowing these phases helps interpret logs and metrics.  
See: [Syncing and Packing](overview/syncing-and-packing.md#replica-29-entropy-generation)

## Step 7 – Run the First-Run Checklist

Verify that your miner is healthy by checking sync progress, storage usage, hashrate, and basic monitoring.  
See: [First-Run Checklist](setup/first-run-checklist.md)

## Step 8 – Move On to Operations and Tuning

Once your miner is stable, start learning how to operate, monitor, troubleshoot, and tune it for better performance and efficiency.  
See: [Operations & Monitoring](operations/operations-monitoring.md), [Troubleshooting](operations/troubleshooting.md), and [Tuning & Optimization](operations/tuning-optimization.md).
