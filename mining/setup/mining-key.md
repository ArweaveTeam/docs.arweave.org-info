In order to produce and sign a block your mining key needs to be present on your machine. If you want to create a new wallet, run `./bin/create-wallet.` The file is then created in `[data_dir]/wallets/.` Make sure you never share it with anyone! If you want to use an existing wallet, place it under the aforementioned path. Note: when using [coordinated mining](coordinated-mining.md), the wallet only needs to be present on the exit node.
