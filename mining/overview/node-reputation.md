  Understanding node reputation
---

Each node maintains a reputation score for all of its peers. This score is based on how much valid dat each peer has shared with it. The more valid data (blocks, transactions, chunks) that a peer shares with a node, that higher that peer's reputation. A node will gossip to and process data from highly rated peers first. Having a high reputation can help get your mined blocks processed and shared across the network more quickly and so can help you "win the race" when you have mined a new block.
